## The Business Challenge

David Jones sells a wide range of seasonal products, including fashion items that see strong swings in demand around holidays like Christmas.

Inventory decisions are especially challenging for seasonal products because:

- Demand can spike unpredictably
- Promotions and discounts influence customer behaviour
- Regional preferences can differ
- Suppliers need advance notice to adjust deliveries

Right now, David Jones is using a **fixed restocking rule**:  

> *Every week, 100 units are delivered to each region, no matter what.*

But with the holiday season approaching, this rigid approach might not be enough.  
You’ve been asked to review the data and advise the company on how to improve its inventory decisions.

Your task is to:  

- Spot patterns in demand
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the current restocking rule
- Recommend improvements to ensure shelves are stocked — but not overstocked

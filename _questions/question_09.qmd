### Exercise 9: Presenting to Management

Imagine you are presenting your recommendation on what to order now to David Jones’ management team.

Write 3-4 sentences summarising:

- What you saw in the data from last year
- What you recommend
- Why this matters for the business

🎯 **Learning Objective**

Students should:

- Practise summarising technical analysis clearly and persuasively for non-technical stakeholders
- Learn to state what they recommend and why, without jargon
- Demonstrate data reasoning through a concise business narrative

✅  **Core Concetpts o Highlight**

Data → Insight → Action chain:

- What happened? (descriptive pattern)
- What does it suggest? (interpretation)
- What should we do? (recommendation)
- Why does this matter? (business value or risk)

No jargon: Students must translate their logic for a time-poor decision-maker.

Confidence + humility: Show a clear recommendation, while acknowledging uncertainty or limits of the data.

💬 **Suggested In-Class Prompts**

“Would your summary be clear to a non-analyst?”

“What would a manager need to know to approve your plan quickly?”

“Did you include both a recommendation and the reason behind it?”

“What assumptions did you make — and did you mention them?”

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

- Writing like an academic report instead of a business memo
- Omitting the actual recommendation (e.g. saying “the data shows…” but not what to do)
- Ignoring uncertainty or sounding overconfident
- Using vague statements like “the data is interesting” without specifics

Last year, Melbourne consistently sold more holiday gift hampers than Sydney — especially in the lead-up to Christmas — and even experienced a stockout. This year, we only have 200 units available for Week 1, so we recommend allocating 120 to Melbourne and 80 to Sydney, based on last year’s proportional demand. While this carries some risk if demand patterns shift, we believe this approach gives us the best chance to meet customer needs in each region. Monitoring early sales trends could help us adjust in future weeks if needed.

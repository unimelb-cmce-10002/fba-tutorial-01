### Exercise 1: What is Inventory Management?

Watch the video "[Inventory Management in 11 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NOER-Lle-0)" and a write 2–3 sentence summary of what you learned. Try to connect what you hear in the video to the challenge David Jones is facing: what makes inventory management tricky, and why is it so important?

🎯 **Learning Objective** 
Students should:

- Understand inventory management as the process of balancing supply and demand
- Identify why inventory decisions are strategic and data-driven, not just logistical
- Recognise core inventory concepts and relate them to a real-world retail scenario (David Jones)

✅  **Core Concetpts o Highlight**

Inventory Management is the process of planning, tracking, and controlling stock so that a business can meet customer demand without holding excess or running out.

In the video, three key techniques are introduced:

**Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):**
A formula used to determine the optimal quantity to order that minimises total inventory costs — including both ordering costs and holding costs.

Think of EOQ as the sweet spot: not too frequent, not too much.

**Safety Stock:**
Extra buffer stock kept on hand to prevent stockouts due to unexpected spikes in demand or delays in delivery.

It’s like a “just-in-case” cushion for uncertainty.

**Reorder Point:**
The inventory level at which a new order should be placed so stock arrives before you run out.

It accounts for delivery lead time + expected demand.


💬 **Suggested In-Class Prompts** (if needed)

“What’s the risk if David Jones doesn’t hold safety stock during Christmas season?”

“EOQ works best in steady environments — what challenges do seasonal spikes present?”

“How might reorder points look different for Sydney vs. Melbourne?”

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

- Assuming inventory management is just about tracking inventory, not planning it.
- Missing the link between inventory and broader business strategy (e.g. promotions, customer satisfaction, working capital).
- Confusing EOQ with a fixed rule — it’s a model that changes with cost and demand inputs.

Inventory management is the process of **planning, tracking, and controlling stock** to ensure a business has the right products available at the right time — without holding too much or too little. 

Techniques like **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), safety stock, and reorder points** help businesses decide when and how much to reorder to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. 

For David Jones, good inventory management is essential during the holiday season, when **demand for gift hampers can spike quickly** — poor planning could mean lost sales, unhappy customers, or leftover stock that must be heavily discounted.

🎯 **Learning Objectives**

Students should:

- Understand the strategic trade-offs between efficiency and responsiveness in inventory systems
- Recognise why traditional cost-minimising models (like lean or just-in-time) may fail under uncertainty
- Apply this idea to real retail planning at David Jones, especially during seasonal peaks

✅  **Core Concepts to Highlight**

**Efficiency vs. Flexibility Trade-off:**
Traditional models aim to reduce waste and cost (e.g. lean, EOQ), but this can create vulnerability when demand is volatile or supply chains are disrupted.

**Resilience in Inventory Planning:**
The article recommends incorporating uncertainty buffers, scenario planning, and dynamic reforecasting into modern inventory models.

**Strategic Implication for Retailers:**
Seasonal demand (like Christmas) is inherently unpredictable. Retailers like David Jones must plan not only for expected demand but also for variance in demand — including regional differences and promotional effects.

💬 Suggested In-Class Prompts

“Why might a perfectly efficient system become a liability during the holidays?”

“What types of uncertainty does David Jones face when planning inventory?”

“How would you build flexibility into a retail inventory strategy?”

“Can you think of a real example where a store ran out of something during a big shopping period?”

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

- Believing that efficiency (lean, just-in-time) is always the best strategy
- Assuming you can forecast demand precisely — students often forget to account for uncertainty
- Treating inventory planning as purely operational rather than strategic and data-informed

(a)
One key challenge is balancing efficiency with flexibility. Many traditional inventory systems aim to minimise costs by keeping stock levels low (like with just-in-time models), but these systems struggle when there is uncertainty or sudden changes in demand. This makes businesses vulnerable to stockouts or delays when things don’t go as planned.

(b)
David Jones experiences unpredictable demand spikes during the holiday season. If they rely on a rigid or overly efficient inventory rule, they risk running out of popular items like gift hampers or over-ordering and being left with excess stock. To avoid this, they need a more flexible approach that can adjust to regional sales trends, promotion effects, and delivery timing issues.

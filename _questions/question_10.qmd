### Exercise 10: Reflection

(a) Which skills of a business data analyst did you use today?
(b) Which steps of the business analytics workflow did you go through?
(c) Why did you adopt either a descriptive, predictive or causal perspective in your analyses? 
(d) How did your perspectives differ from other groups and how did this change the approach and results?

🎯 Learning Objective

Students should:

- Reflect on their own analytic process, and not just the outcome
- Build awareness of the skills they’re developing
- Understand how different analytical perspectives (descriptive, predictive, causal) shape decision-making
- Recognise the value of group diversity in thinking and approach

✅  **Core Concepts to Highlight**

Reflection is an essential part of learning analytics — analysts must regularly evaluate:

- What was my approach?
- What worked? What didn’t?
- How did others see it differently?

Students should recognise:

- That they applied multiple skills from the business scientist toolkit
- That the business analytics workflow isn’t always linear — they may loop back or skip steps
- That different groups might reason differently from the same data, and that’s okay — or even productive

💬 **Suggested In-Class Prompts**

“Did anyone change their mind during the group activity? Why?”

“Was your perspective more descriptive, predictive, or causal — and was that intentional?”

“Which skill do you feel you used most? Which one do you want to practise more?”

“How did your group’s workflow compare to the ‘ideal’ process?”

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

- Writing vague or generic answers like “I analysed data” without specifying how
- Listing skills without explaining where they applied
- Failing to acknowledge different group approaches or tradeoffs

There is no one right answer here. 

But here's what a good response might look like:

Today I used analytical thinking to explore patterns in sales data, as well as problem formulation to frame a useful research question. I also used business context awareness to interpret regional demand differences and promotion timing.

We followed most steps of the business analytics workflow: we defined the problem, explored and analysed data, and made a recommendation.

Our group mostly took a predictive perspective — using past data to estimate future demand — though we also used descriptive thinking to identify when stockouts occurred.

Another group focused more on causal reasoning — trying to isolate the effects of price changes — which led them to different inventory recommendations. This showed me how different perspectives can shape conclusions, even when using the same data.

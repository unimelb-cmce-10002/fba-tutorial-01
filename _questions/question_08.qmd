### Exercise 8: Planning for This Year's Holiday Season

David Jones’ supplier is asking you to confirm delivery quantities **now**, so they can prepare for the season ahead.

(a) How many units should you order for Sydney and Melbourne for the first week of the holiday season?
(b) Justify your decision based on last year's patterns and your reasoning. Consider factors like demand trends, regional differences, price effects, and promotion timing.
(c) Suppose the supplier has limited capacity and can only supply 200 units total for the first week.  How would you allocate this stock between Sydney and Melbourne? What are the risks of your choice?

🎯 Learning Objective

Students should:

- Practise translating data patterns into constrained decisions
- Acknowledge and question the assumptions behind their recommendations
- Use descriptive, predictive, or causal thinking to justify allocation choices

✅  **Core Concetpts o Highlight**

- Data-informed allocation: Matching supply to past observed demand
- Proportional decision logic: A simple but reasoned approach when detailed forecasting isn’t possible
- Explicit assumption-making: Good analysts acknowledge what they don’t know
- This is an opportunity to model real-world decision-making under uncertainty, where you must act now but only have imperfect information.

💬 **Suggested In-Class Prompts**

“Why did you choose that allocation? What data supports it?”

“What assumptions are you making about demand this year?”

“Push students to explain why they trust last year’s data. Should we assume stability year over year?”

“Encourage groups to discuss how their allocation might go wrong — not just defend it.”

“Challenge groups that split 100/100: is that fair or just easy?”

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

* Assuming last year = this year without qualification
* Ignoring how promotion timing or external events could shift demand
* Failing to discuss risks or alternatives in case of misallocation
* Treating equal splits as default fairness (rather than strategic decision)

📝 **Optional Extension Prompt**

What if you could change the delivery proportions in earlier weeks (still assuming a 200 unit cap in total?) Might that change your answer?

**Unconstrained scenario:**

Based on last year’s sales in the first week of the season (25 Nov), Melbourne sold 150 units while Sydney sold 100. Given this pattern and **assuming similar demand and pricing this year**, we recommend ordering:

- Melbourne: 150 units
- Sydney: 100 units

This matches observed demand and adjusts the previous fixed rule to better reflect regional differences.

**Constrained Scenario:** 

Based on last year’s Week 1 sales (25 Nov), Melbourne sold 150 units and Sydney sold 100 — a 60:40 demand split. Assuming similar demand patterns this year, we propose the following allocation:

Melbourne: 120 units

Sydney: 80 units

This proportional allocation preserves observed demand ratios while fitting within the 200-unit constraint.

Assumptions:

- We assume last year’s demand is a reasonable guide for this year.
- We assume supply constraints are fixed and inflexible (i.e. we can't reorder mid-season).
- We assume there are no major regional marketing changes this year (e.g. no extra advertising / price changes).

Risks:

- If demand increases (e.g. due to earlier or stronger promotions), understocking is likely.
- If regional patterns shift, the proportional rule may misallocate units — e.g. underestimating growth in Sydney.
- Without real-time data, it’s hard to adjust — we’d ideally revisit this weekly.

Data reasoning:

Our decision uses descriptive analysis (last year’s observed sales), predictive reasoning (similar patterns expected), and light causal inference (we infer regional differences reflect customer demand, not supply issues).

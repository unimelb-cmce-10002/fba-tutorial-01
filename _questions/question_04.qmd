🎯  **Learning Objective**
Students should:

Recognise the variety of data types relevant to inventory decisions

Think beyond sales totals to consider timing, location, operations, and marketing

Practise connecting data sources to concrete decisions (e.g., ordering, pricing, promotion)

✅  **Core Concepts to Highlight**

Sales data: Disaggregated by region, product, and time — foundational for demand forecasting.

Operational data: Inventory levels, delivery lead times, stockouts — needed for supply planning.

Marketing data: Promotion schedules, price changes, advertising — useful for understanding demand spikes.

Customer data: Foot traffic, preferences, order patterns — can help in longer-term planning.

Principle: Good inventory decisions rely on data across teams/business functionalities — not just sales.

💬 **Suggested In-Class Prompts**

“What data would you ask for first if you were joining the David Jones inventory team today?”

“How would you use sales data differently from promotion data?”

“Can you make a strong inventory decision without knowing delivery lead times?”

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

- Focusing only on sales and ignoring supply-side factors
- Listing data without explaining how it would help (encourage justification!)
- Confusing nice-to-have data (e.g. customer opinions) with essential operational data

**Weekly sales data by region** – This helps identify demand trends over time and differences between Sydney and Melbourne.

**Promotion calendar and price changes** – To understand how discounts or campaigns affect sales volume and timing.

**Supplier delivery lead times** – So the team knows how far in advance they need to place orders to receive stock in time.

Optional extras might include customer foot traffic, stockout incidents, or competitor activity if available. Other answers data sets that appear sensible are also OK to include.

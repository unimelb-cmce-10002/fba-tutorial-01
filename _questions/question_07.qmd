### Exercise 7: Exploring Last Year's Data

The team now wants to use **last year's data** to improve inventory decisions for the upcoming holiday season.

As the new group of analysts in the company, you‚Äôve been asked to review what happened and make recommendations for this year‚Äôs strategy.

The data you have to work from are provided below:


| Week Commencing | Region    | Starting Inventory | Units Delivered | Units Sold | Ending Inventory | Price (AUD) | Promotion (Y/N) |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| 25 Nov          | Sydney    | 500              | 100            | 100        | 500             | 50          | N              |
| 25 Nov          | Melbourne | 500              | 100            | 150        | 450             | 50          | N              |
| 2 Dec           | Sydney    | 500              | 100            | 180        | 420             | 45          | Y              |
| 2 Dec           | Melbourne | 450              | 100            | 220        | 330             | 45          | Y              |
| 9 Dec           | Sydney    | 420              | 100            | 150        | 370             | 45          | Y              |
| 9 Dec           | Melbourne | 330              | 100            | 100        | 330             | 45          | Y              |
| 16 Dec          | Sydney    | 370              | 100            | 400        | 70              | 40          | Y (Christmas)  |
| 16 Dec          | Melbourne | 330              | 100            | 400        | 30              | 40          | Y (Christmas)  |
| 23 Dec          | Sydney    | 70               | 100            | 120        | 50              | 50          | N              |
| 23 Dec          | Melbourne | 30               | 100            | 150        | -20 (backorder) | 50          | N              |

Follow the three-step approach below to draw conclusions about what happened in the previous year.


#### Step 1: Observe
(a) What patterns do you notice in sales over time?
(b) How do price changes and the Christmas promotion relate to changes in sales?
(c) What differences stand out between Sydney and Melbourne?

#### Step 2: Analyse
(a) How well is the fixed restocking rule working in each region?
(b) When did inventory levels become risky?
(c) Were there signs earlier in the data that could have helped predict this?

####  Step 3: Predict & Explain
(a) If nothing changes, what do you expect to happen next week?
(b) What factors might be driving the differences between the two regions?
(c) What other data would help you explain or predict these patterns more confidently?

üéØ **Learning Objective**

Students should:

- Practise descriptive analysis of time-series and regional patterns
- Identify predictive warning signs in the data
- Begin developing causal hypotheses (e.g. ‚Äúsales increased because of promotion or price drop‚Äù)

‚úÖ  **Core Concetpts to Highlight**

Descriptive vs. Predictive vs. Causal lenses:

- Descriptive: What happened and when?
- Predictive: What might happen again if we don‚Äôt act?
- Causal: What factors likely caused these changes?

Inventory stress points:

- Look for low ending inventory and stockouts.
- Ask: were these avoidable based on earlier patterns?

Restocking logic:

- The rule is fixed (100/week), but demand is not.
- Students should challenge this with data evidence.

Promotion and pricing effects:

- Show how promotions (esp. week of 2 Dec) drove sales.
- Push students to distinguish between correlation and likely cause.

üí¨ **Suggested In-Class Prompts** 

‚ÄúWhen would you have raised a red flag about inventory levels?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid the same promotion have the same impact in both cities?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of data would help you confirm your explanations?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre there different insights if you take a descriptive vs. predictive lens?‚Äù

üìå **Common Misunderstandings**

Assuming promotion caused sales without considering other factors

Failing to compare across regions (Sydney vs Melbourne)

Describing what happened without suggesting how it could have been anticipated or avoided

Step 1: Observe

- Sales increased steadily from late November into December, with a major spike in the week of 16 Dec ‚Äî likely due to the Christmas promotion.
- Sydney and Melbourne had similar trends, but Melbourne consistently sold more units and even experienced a stockout in the final week.
- Price drops and promotions seem to directly increase sales.

Step 2: Analyse

- The fixed restocking rule (100 units per week) worked early on, but failed to match demand as it surged ‚Äî especially in Melbourne.
- Inventory in Melbourne dipped to dangerously low levels by early December. Sydney fared better but still ended with low stock.
- The promotion started on 2 Dec, so we could have anticipated higher demand from that week and adjusted stock accordingly.

Step 3: Predict & Explain

- If David Jones keeps the same restocking pattern, they‚Äôll likely understock again during peak season.
- Regional demand differences (e.g. Melbourne being stronger), combined with promotion timing and price sensitivity, are key drivers.
- More detailed customer-level data (e.g. purchase history, response to past promotions) or store traffic data could help explain the variation and improve predictions.

üéØ **Learning Objective**

Students should:

- Connect the David Jones inventory problem to specific skills in the business scientist toolkit
- Recognise that different problems require different mixes of skills
- Reflect on their own strengths and development areas

‚úÖ  **Core Concetpts to Highlight**

Introduce or reinforce the 8 skills of a business scientist from the FBA book:

1. Understand the Business World (Institutional Detail)
Grasp seasonal patterns, logistics, and operations.

2. Find the Right Data (Data Discovery)
Know what data exists, who owns it, and how to access it.

3. Understand People and Firms (Business Theory)
Explain why demand shifts ‚Äî e.g. promotions, regional habits.

4. Choose the Right Tool (Analytical Models)
Use appropriate summaries or models to understand demand.

5. Know What Can Go Wrong (Analytical Theory)
Spot risk of misleading results ‚Äî like outliers or unrepresentative patterns.

6. Work with Code and Technology (Computational Skills)
Clean and analyse data using reproducible workflows.

7. Communicate What You Find (Presentation & Communication)
Clearly explain results and persuade decision-makers.

7. Ask the Right Questions (Creativity & Judgment)
Turn a vague challenge into a testable, decision-relevant question.

Emphasise: Most analysts won‚Äôt use all eight in every project ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay.
The goal is to build awareness of what the problem demands, and what the analyst brings to it.

üí¨ **Suggested In-Class Prompts**

‚ÄúWhich three skills would be most important for you in this problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich of these skills do you already feel confident in?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you think of similar business problem where a different skill mix would matter more?‚Äù

üìå **Common Misunderstandings** 

Thinking analytics = coding or modelling only

Overlooking the importance of business context, judgment, or communication

Not recognising that skills can be shared across a team

Solving this inventory problem at David Jones would draw on several skills.

Arguably, the most essential here are:

1. Understand the Business World (Institutional Detail): You need to know how retail and seasonal promotions work to interpret the data meaningfully.
2. Ask the Right Questions (Creativity & Judgment): You must turn the inventory issue into focused, answerable questions about demand patterns and delivery timing.
3. Choose the Right Tool (Analytical Models): You‚Äôll need to summarise sales patterns and maybe even predict demand ‚Äî so you need to choose the right level of analysis.

Other skills, like Presentation & Communication or Computational Skills, depend more on the context ‚Äî if you're presenting to managers, communication is key; if scaling the solution with a model over multiple markets, coding might matters more. Not every analyst will use every skill on every problem, but strong solutions often involve a mix of both essential and context-specific skills.
